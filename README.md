# Data-Structure-Project-III
application to maintain information for school classes


# Summary
this project is an application to	maintain information for school	classes based on a Binary	 Search	 Tree	data structure.

# Specifications

For	each	of the	students	in	a	class, the following	information	is kept:	a	unique	student	ID,	student	name,	home	address (city),	id	of	class	he	is	currently	in,	and	date	of	enrollment.	For	keeping	track	of	the	students,	the	school	secretary	would use a	 computer program based on a Binary	 Search	 Tree	data structure.	
 Write	a	program	to	help	the	secretary,	by	implementing the	following operations:
• Insert	a student with	all	its	associated	data.
• Find	a	student	by	his/her student	ID,	and	support	updating	of	the	student	info	if	found.
• List	all	students	in	the lexicographic	order	of	their	names.
• Search	for	a	city	and	list	all	students	from	that	city in	lexicographic	order	of	their	names.
• List	all	students	by	their	class	in	the lexicographic	order	of	their	names.
• Delete	a	student	given	his/her	student	ID.
• Save	all	students	in	file	students.data.
• Exit
